This poses a significant threat, particularly considering the popularity of DeepSeek-R1 and the beta status of DeepSeek-R2, which could allow attackers to take advantage of user trust and distribute a model that conceals a crypto miner download. Users who are unaware and enthusiastic about trying out DeepSeek-R2 may fall victim to this threat. Notably, the malicious model is in PyTorch format, contrasting with the official DeepSeek models, which utilize the safetensors format.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/RealTimePostImage/post/malicious-deepseek%E2%80%91r2-pytorch-model-discovered-hosting-xmrig-miner-post.png\"></p>\n","excerpt":"Our security research team has discovered a harmful PyTorch model on @huggingface, identified as dtonala/DeepSeek-R2, which is delivering the XMRig cryptominer as its payload.
