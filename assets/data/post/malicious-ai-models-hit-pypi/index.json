Today, we observed a fresh attack targeting developers through the PyPI repository: an infected Torch AI model was loaded in two malicious PyPI packages to deploy obfuscated malware. The two malicious packages were published by a user named ai-aliyun: ai-labs-snippets-sdk, aliyun-ai-labs-snippets-sdk. The name mimics Aliyun, Alibaba’s cloud platform, to make it appear trustworthy and gain downloads.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/RealTimePostImage/post/Malicious-AI-Models-Hit-PyPI-1.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>Once installed, the package supposedly loads a PyTorch model from a file called <code>model.pt</code>.\nDuring the loading, obfuscated Python code is executed after being decoded as base64.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/RealTimePostImage/post/Malicious-AI-Models-Hit-PyPI-2.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>The payload gathers system information and exfiltrates it to <code>aksjdbajkb2jeblad[.]oss-cn-hongkong[.]aliyuncs[.]com</code>, which is hosted on Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun), adding another layer of disguise to the operation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/RealTimePostImage/post/Malicious-AI-Models-Hit-PyPI-3.png\"></p>\n<p>Protecting against malicious ML models is a complex task.
