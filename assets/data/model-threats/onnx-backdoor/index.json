For example - in models that take image files as input, the trigger could be adding a red pixel to the input image in a very specific location.</p>\n<p>Once the backdoor is activated, the model will produce attacker-chosen outputs instead of outputs calculated via the model's intended logic.</p>\n<p>A backdoored model can be extremely dangerous, for example - if attackers manage to compromise a computer vision model embedded in cars that's responsible for identifying street signs, they could cause car collisions under very specific conditions, which would be hard to trace back to the compromised model.</p>\n<h2 id=\"time-of-infection\"><a href=\"#time-of-infection\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\">Time of Infection</a></h2>\n<p>[] Model Load</p>\n<p><strong>[v] Model Query</strong></p>\n<p>[] Other</p>\n<h2 id=\"additional-information\"><a href=\"#additional-information\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\">Additional Information</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://hiddenlayer.com/innovation-hub/shadowlogic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://hiddenlayer.com/innovation-hub/shadowlogic/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07840\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07840</a></li>\n</ul>\n","description":"ONNX model with architectural backdoor causing unexpected outputs"}},"context":{}}
