Our security research team has discovered a harmful PyTorch model on [@huggingface](https://x.com/huggingface), identified as **dtonala/DeepSeek-R2**, which is delivering the **XMRig cryptominer** as its payload. This poses a significant threat, particularly considering the popularity of DeepSeek-R1 and the beta status of DeepSeek-R2, which could allow attackers to take advantage of user trust and distribute a model that conceals a crypto miner download. Users who are unaware and enthusiastic about trying out DeepSeek-R2 may fall victim to this threat. Notably, the malicious model is in PyTorch format, contrasting with the official DeepSeek models, which utilize the safetensors format.
