Summary
-------------------
Resource exhaustion in netty's Bzip2 decoder leads to denial of service.

Component
-------------------
[Netty](https://github.com/netty/netty) (appears X times in Artifactory, Y weekly downloads)

Affected versions
-------------------
[4.1.0 - 4.1.67], fixed in 4.1.68

Description
-------------------
[netty](https://github.com/netty/netty) is a popular client/server framework which enables quick and easy development of network applications such as protocol servers and clients.

A vulnerability was found in netty's Bzip2 decoder - when using the netty library and accepting arbitrary data streams to decode, netty does not limit the stream in any way.
An attacker that can submit a big file to decompress, may cause memory exhaustion which will lead to denial of service on the netty daemon process and possibly other processes on the same machine.
