## Summary

Heap out-of-bounds read in ClickHouse LZ4 codec can allow an authenticated network attacker to perform denial of service or information leakage

## Component

[Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/)

## Affected versions

(, v21.9.5.16-stable], fixed in v21.10.2.15-stable

## Description

As part of the `LZ4::decompressImpl` loop, a 16-bit unsigned user-supplied value is read from the compressed data and used in a subsequent subtraction. There is no verification that the result of the subtraction is larger than a base pointer used as the source of a copy operation, leading to a heap overread.

## PoC

No PoC is supplied for this issue

## Vulnerability mitigations

If upgrading is not possible, add firewall rules in the server that will restrict the access to the web port (8123) and the TCP serverâ€™s port (9000) for only specific clients.
