## Summary
NicheStack TCP header IP length integer overflow leads to DoS

## Component

[InterNiche TCP/IP stack](https://www.hcc-embedded.com/products/networking/tcpip-applications)

## Affected versions

## Description

NicheStack TCP header processing code doesnâ€™t sanitize the length of the IP length (header + data). With a crafted IP packet an integer overflow would occur whenever the length of the IP data is calculated by subtracting the length of the header from the length of the total IP packet
